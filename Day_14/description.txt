I ran the real data for 1000 cycles outputing the score.
I then number of times each score was present in the 1000.
There were serval scores that only had one occurance.
I noticed there were a lot of 11's and 12's.
Above that there were 22's and 24's.
There were some additional multiples.

I looked at the scores with 12 occurances figuring that at the 1000 point I must be between the 11th and 12th
repeat of the pattern.

I looked at all the 12's and found the lowest cycle index which was 101.
That meant the first 100 cyles were narrowing down.  The beginning of the repeating pattern started with cycle 101.

Difference between scores in the pattern was 78. 
Meaning the lenght or period of the pattern was 78.

(1000000000 - 100) mod 78 = 42

Meaning cycle 1000000000 was at point 42 in the pattern.
The cycle started at 101 (the offset before the pattern started was 100.)

The score at cycle 1000000000 was the same as the cycle at 142   (42 + 100)

Plugged that in and submitted it and bingo.  Winner winner.
